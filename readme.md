[TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) has a great success across the community, helping the developers to choose an MVC framework that perfectly suits their project needs.

Some time ago Facebook presented a new application paradigm for building client-side applications called Flux. It gained a lot of attraction, and, as a result of it, dozens of frameworks and different Flux implementations came out.

Isn't it a perfect time to start [TodoFlux](http://todoflux.com) project to help the community to sort out all the things around Flux?
